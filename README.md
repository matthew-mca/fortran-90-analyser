# A Python-based Code Analyser for Fortran 90 Code
***
This project aims to use Python to develop a code analysis tool for the programming language 
[Fortran 90](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortran). 

## Project Specs and Workflow
***
With this project only starting, there's not really too much to say yet besides a few of the main tools that are being
used for development! The version of Python used in this project is **Python 3.11**. In the interest of consistency and 
keeping things informative, I have opted to use the code formatter [Black](https://github.com/psf/black) to keep things 
tidy, as well as using the static type checker [Mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy) to help with type hinting.

Besides the initial commits to set up the repo, any and all implementations made in this project will be done via merge
request. Each merge request will be linked to an issue to allow myself (and anyone else who views the repo) to track
current and completed tasks.

***This README will likely change and expand as the project progresses.***
